# Monte Carlo Option Pricing

This repository provides a comprehensive and modular framework for pricing European and exotic options using Monte Carlo simulations. The implementation includes variance reduction techniques, Greek estimations, and a Streamlit-based UI for interactive exploration.

## Features

- European option pricing using Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo
- Asian options (arithmetic & geometric average) via Monte Carlo and analytic formulas
- Variance reduction: Antithetic variates, Control variates
- Delta and Gamma estimation using finite difference and CRN
- Streamlit interface for user interaction
- Extensive Jupyter Notebooks for convergence, sensitivity, and visualization
- Test suite with pytest
- Utility modules for reproducibility, simulation, and plotting

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m0rtifer0/MonteCarloOptionPricing
   cd MonteCarloOptionPricing
